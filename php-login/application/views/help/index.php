    <h2>My Profile</h2>

 
<h4>How do I edit my profile?</h4>

You can edit your profile at any point by clicking on the Edit My Profile tab on the header at the top of your Dashboard. Certain information may not be edited, e.g. your user name and your industry.

 
<h4>Can I change my user name and password?</h4>

You received a generic user name and password in your initial confirmation email. For your reference, your user name is the email address you used when registering with the Green Business Network.

You will not be able to change your user name. Your initial password was generated using your Green Business Network membership number. You may change your password at any point by going into Edit My Profile.

 
<h4>Why do I need to answer the additional questions on the My Profile page?</h4>

The additional questions in the Edit My Profile page are part of our general membership application process. Our Standards Committee reviews this information to obtain a complete picture of the scope of your company’s operations during the Gold level certification review process (see details below).

<h2>My Assessment</h2>

 
<h4>How does the Assessment work?</h4>

The Assessment is a quick way to determine your certification level. On the Assessment page, check off the initiatives your company has already completed and click ‘submit’ at the bottom of the page to see your score. If you are not sure whether you’ve completed an item, choose ‘No’ as your response for now. You won’t be penalized for it. If the initiative question does not apply to your business, click N/A. Please remember, each initiative you check will appear in your public Sustainability Profile.

 
<h4>Can I save my answers in the assessment?</h4>

You can come back to the assessment at any point. Your answers are saved after you hit the submit button, so you can go back and review or change your responses by clicking the ‘My Assessment’ tab on the header in your Dashboard.

 
<h4>Will my assessment responses be saved automatically if the program times out?</h4>

If you are unable to complete the assessment in one sitting and the program times out, your work will automatically be saved (it usually times out after about 45 minutes). You can retrieve and complete your assessment in your Dashboard by clicking the ‘My Assessment’ tab on the header in your Dashboard.

 
<h4>Will I be penalized if I answer ‘No’ or ‘N/A’ in the assessment?</h4>

You will not be penalized if you answer ‘No’ or ‘N/A’ in the assessment. The assessment questions are designed to give us a quick overview of your tier status in our certification program. Once you submit your assessment, you are taken to your Dashboard where can review your initial score and revisit all of the initiatives from the assessment. They will be listed in several tabs based on your initial responses in the assessment. Your ‘Yes’ responses will appear in the ‘Completed’ tab. Your ‘No’ responses will appear in the ‘Recommendations’ tab, and your ‘N/A’ responses will appear in the ‘Postpone’ tab.

 
<h4>How can I print my assessment results?</h4>

You can print your assessment results from your Dashboard by simply printing the screen. Make sure to highlight the correct tab you want to print, ie. ‘Recommendations’, ‘Completed’, or ‘Postponed,’ and click the ‘Show More in this Category’ button to show all initiatives in each category before printing.

<h2>My Dashboard</h2>

 
<h4>What is My Dashboard use for?</h4>

The Dashboard is your main portal where you can see your score, view your progress, and plan out your next steps. The My Progress section gives you an overview of your performance in each category, your total points earned to date, and the number of points and pre-requisites you still need to reach the next certification level. To earn more points, you can scroll down to the Earn More Points section below My Progress.

 
<h4>I can’t see my results in My Dashboard. Why do I get a blank screen?</h4>

A blank screen most likely indicates Internet browser compatibility issues. GreenGain works best with newer versions of browsers, so make sure to download browser updates regularly. If you are using Internet Explorer, use version 9.0 or above. To report an issue, please click on the Support link in the Footer below, or simply email <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">greengain@greenamerica.org</span>.

 
<h4>What are the tabs for in the Earn More Points section?</h4>

In this section on your Dashboard, you can see recommendations for next steps in the Recommendations tab, the initiatives you have already completed in the Completed tab, and the initiatives you have postponed in the Postponed tab. Click on each of the tabs to view a complete list. In each tab, the initiatives are grouped by category. Make sure to click on the ‘Show More in This Category’ button to see a complete list of initiatives for each category.

 
<h4>How do I earn more points?</h4>

You can earn more points by completing the initiatives in the Recommendations tab on your Dashboard. Click on each initiative if you would like to learn more or need some how-to advice. In order to reach the next Seal level, you must accumulate enough points and complete the pre-requisite initiatives for that tier (see 'Core Practices’ category).

 
<h4>What are initiatives?</h4>

Initiatives are specific and operational actions your company can take to improve sustainability performance in your company. Some initiatives are simple to implement, while others require more investment in time and money.

 
<h4>How do I complete an initiative?</h4>

There are two response types for initiatives. Most initiatives can be completed simply by clicking on the ‘Complete’ button. Certain initiatives, however, require an answer. In these cases, when you click on the ‘Answer’ button, you will be directed to the Initiative Detail Page (link to initiative #???) where you will be asked to fill out additional information. If it is an open-ended question, you must submit a written response in the text field below the question. If it is a multiple-choice question, you will also be directed to the Initiative Detail Page (link to initiative #???). You must select one of the choices from the drop-down menu below the question.

 
<h4>Can I undo completed initiatives?</h4>

You can move initiatives around at any point on your Dashboard. For instance, if you want to complete an initiative in the Postponed tab, just click the complete button and it will automatically move into the Completed tab. If you want to undo a completed initiative, click on the Undo button, and it will automatically move into the Recommendations tab.

 
<h4>What if an initiative doesn’t apply to my business?</h4>

The assessment is designed to ask questions for broadly defined industries. We recognize that not all questions are relevant to all businesses, so we have provided an N/A option for questions in the assessment. We are continuously working to refine initiatives for specific application to each industry, particularly as best practices improve and industries change. Please check in regularly to review updates to the tool. Green America sees this as a process of mutual reflection and learning, so we welcome your feedback at any point. Please submit ideas or comments on each ‘Initiative Detail Page’ or click on the ‘Have a Suggestion’ button on your Dashboard. You can also email us at <span style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">greengain@greenamerica.org</span>.

 
<h4>Do I have to answer every recommended initiative in order to reach the next tier?</h4>

No. In order to reach the next tier, you simply have to earn the minimum amount of points and meet the pre-requisite initiatives required for that tier. Each individual initiative is worth a specific number of points, with more difficult initiatives carrying greater weight than ones that are simpler to complete.

 
<h4>How are the initiatives ordered on my Dashboard?</h4>

To help you prioritize your planning strategically, GreenGain lists initiatives in order of return on investment, showing those with the highest social and environmental benefit and the lowest investment in time and money first. Think of your Dashboard as an a la carte menu. Our points system gives you the flexibility to choose how you reach your goal. We want to help your business transition to sustainable practices without breaking the bank!
How do I achieve a Gold Level Seal?

Once your business completes the Gold level Core Practice Initiatives and has earned enough points to reach Gold, Green America’s Standards Committee will review your overall performance in GreenGain to determine the scope of your commitment to social and environmental responsibility.

 
<h4>How does the Gold level review process work?</h4>

When the Standards Committee has completed their review, they will notify you via email to log into your GreenGain account for follow-up questions. Click on the ‘Gold Only’ tab under the Earn More Points section on your Dashboard to review their questions. Respond in the same field directly below the follow-up questions. The Standards Committee will then review your responses, follow up with additional questions as needed, and activate your Gold level certification upon approval.

 
<h4>How long does the Gold level standards review process take?</h4>

Since we pride ourselves on being thorough, the standards review process may take up to 8 weeks (a little longer for franchises and more complex business models). In the end, each business is provided detailed feedback about how it can improve. We offer recommendations for initiatives to complete next, as well as concrete examples, ideas, materials and contacts to be even more sustainable.

 
<h4>How do I download my Seal of Approval logo?</h4>

Each Seal of Approval logo is embedded with HTML code for you to download onto your website. Click on the Download your Seal of Approval Now button on your Dashboard to obtain the snippet of code. Copy and paste it into the HTML code of your website in the appropriate place.

 
<h4>Why do I need the HTML code for my Seal of Approval logo?</h4>

The HTML code connects your Seal of Approval logo to a public Sustainability Profile showing your company’s performance in our GreenGain certification program. This allows consumers and the general public to see what specific achievements your company has made in social and environmental responsibility.

 
<h4>How can I review or edit what will appear on my public Sustainability Profile?</h4>

You can review the information that appears on your public sustainability profile by clicking on the My Profile tab on the header of your Dashboard. You have the ability to edit your contact information on this page by clicking on the Edit My Profile tab. Click the refresh button on your browser, and your public sustainability profile will updated automatically. If you want to change any of your completed initiatives, go back to the Earn More Points section on your Dashboard and click ‘Undo’ next to the specific initiative in the Postponed tab.
